> What's ADB Shellkit?

ADB Shellkit gives you access to the hidden system commands that came with your phone.

- Works on both rooted and non-rooted devices
- Easy way to access and run system commands such as top, logcat, disk usage, rooted commands, pretty colors and formatted display
- Save output to numerous sharing options (files, mail, google drive, etc)
- Run your own system commands or select one from my library
- User saved commands with configured shell variables 
- A good and growing list of global system commands you can use

> What's the plan?

We plan to get a new release with all the new features, bug fixes, etc on the Google Play store soon. There have been a good amount of changes and as soon as we get a stable release workflow and sign off on it, it will be posted. From there on the plan is to do continuous releases.
